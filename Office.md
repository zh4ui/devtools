# Office

## Tips


**Change MS Office Theme**

To change the background color and design of all your Office programs, go to File > Account from any open Office program, and then click the drop down menu next to Office Theme. (Or, go to File > Options > General > Office Theme).

**Change font style for +Headings and +Body**

The font style for +Headings and +Body comes from the theme of a document.

Change it by clicking on menu: "Design > Fonts > Customize Fonts".

**Link Text Boxes**

In Word, "Insert > Text Box > Draw Horizontal | Vertical Text Box" can create a text box. However, this text box can only be within a page. If you want the content in a text box to appear on different text boxes, you need to link the text boxes on different pages together. This is done by using "Format | Create Link", and pointing the cursor on a empty text box.

## Word

### [Word: Disable spell checker for a paragraph?]

```
OK, I guess I found it and it's quite simple:

    select the part of the document where you want to disable spell checking
    click the language in the status bar
    select the check box "Do not check spelling or grammar"
    click OK

For Word 2010/2013/2016 you have use Review ribbon menu. Click Language and then Set proofing language. You can disable spell and grammar check there even you can select a different language for proofing.

## Outlook

### Troubleshooting

**Cannot Manage Rules and Alerts**

Problem:

[Outlook Error: "The operation failed..." when selecting Manage Rules & Alerts](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/outlook-error-the-operation-failed-when-selecting-manage-rules-alerts-64b6ff77-98c2-4564-9cbf-25bd8e17fb8b)
