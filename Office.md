## Tips


**Change MS Office Theme**

To change the background color and design of all your Office programs, go to File > Account from any open Office program, and then click the drop down menu next to Office Theme. (Or, go to File > Options > General > Office Theme).

**Change font style for +Headings and +Body**

The font style for +Headings and +Body comes from the theme of a document.

Change it by clicking on menu: "Design > Fonts > Customize Fonts".

**Link Text Boxes**

In Word, "Insert > Text Box > Draw Horizontal | Vertical Text Box" can create a text box. However, this text box can only be within a page. If you want the content in a text box to appear on different text boxes, you need to link the text boxes on different pages together. This is done by using "Format | Create Link", and pointing the cursor on a empty text box.
